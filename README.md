# Pygame-Tetris
creating a simple tetris game using 2D arrays


there are multiple ways of building Tetris, the reason I went into 2D arrays for the tetrominos,
I believe it help us to visualize how tetrominos will take place in the main grid, 

also it makes it easier to implement this poject into another progaming language like C
